# Python Rescher Network

Inspired by Nicholas Rescher's 1966 paper Cause and Counterfactual, this repository houses the application and combination of symbolic regression and graph theory in the context of causal analysis. 

The program analyzes data by building a symbolic model of the relationships between variables and builds a causal network based on other models with shared variables.
